# AquaSense: IoT-Enabled Smart Tumbler 💧📱

## 📘 Project Context

This project focuses on creating an IoT-enabled solution to monitor daily water intake. By integrating smart sensors into a tumbler, users receive notifications via a mobile app or on the tumbler itself, prompting them to stay hydrated conveniently and consistently.

---

## 🎯 General Objective

The aim of this study is to develop an **IoT Tumbler Sensor System** to track and encourage users' daily water consumption habits. The system enhances hydration awareness through smart sensors and real-time notifications.

---

## ✅ Specific Objectives

- Design and implement an IoT sensor system for monitoring tumbler water levels.
- Develop an intuitive and user-friendly mobile application to interact with the IoT Tumbler Sensor.
- Integrate a notification system that uses both the mobile app and tumbler indicators to prompt hydration.

---

## 📦 Scope

### 1. IoT Tumbler Sensor System

- Integration of smart sensors and IoT technologies to monitor water levels.
- Designed to promote healthy hydration habits.

### 2. User-Friendly Mobile Application
